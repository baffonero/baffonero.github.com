Our relationship with numbers is really weird.
At school we hate our maths teacher and we skip school for not having to deal with differential equations and logarithms.


Later you realize that everyone loves numbers.
My apps have a Facebook page. I am always amazed at how the posts that contain "numbers" are more popular than those that don't.

We like sports stats, we like rankings, we like lists: everything that contains numbers seems more "colorful" (except maybe the numbers of our bank account).

What has this to do with a startup?

I think it's a winning idea to "cook" contents with numbers and statistics.
As users we love to our game stats, performance, rank of our opponents (and maybe we are even willing to pay for it).
There are endless possibilities to enrich your applications with numbers.

I use MongoDB and the fact that it is so fast in queries allows you to offer contents based on statistics to lots of users (and amazingly the server won't burn).

While writing this post I found this interesting book:

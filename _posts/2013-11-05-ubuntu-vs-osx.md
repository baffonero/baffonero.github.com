About 2 years ago I started developing on daily basis using Node.js, Mongodb and Redis.
My first attempt was using a windows laptop, but very soon I begun struggling with software installation.
I was frustrated with this situation, so I started searching for a solution.
Attracted by all this nice guys at the conferences going around with their awesom Apple Laptops I realized that a MacBook Air would be my nirvana.
Unfortunately I was out of money at that time (the situation is not so better at the moment tough) so I made due with something cheaper, installing Ubuntu in dual boot.

Since that day I fell in love with linux and Ubuntu Monospace Font.

To be honest my Toshiba laptop hardware doesn't fit Ubuntu nicely, so I'm headed to a computer switch.

And now?

Should I switch to Osx?

No, thanks...I'm too old for such a change.

I prefer to stick with Ubuntu, so:

better to install it on a MacBook Air or get an alternative such a Dell xps13?

I've been using Unity3D for a week now, this is what impressed me more.

Separation
-----------
In Unity I found a clear (and pleasant) separation between graphics elements, animations and code.
This make me think that wouldn't be so difficult to parallelize work in your team. In the next days I'll search for teamwork stories on Unity...I'm very curious about that.

Reliability
------------
The IDE seems to be very solid. 

Ease of Testing
----------
Unity is a sort of What You See is What You Get IDE. Most of the time you'll work on something that you can test in minutes. You have to adjust to some peculiarity but I have good sensations :-)

It's all for the moment, I'll keep you posted about my progress ;-)

Today is one of those days when my start-up crusade take me away from my code and from my data analysys.
I have a business meeting 300 km far from here. 
By the end of the day I'll take 4 trains, 2 taxis and will spend lots of money for an uncertain outcome. 
I hate this!

In situations like these coffee plays a huge role.

When my travels take me towards Santa Maria Novella Rail Station the place to go for a good espresso and croissant is "Bar Tonarelli".
There are 2 or 3 more "Bar" inside the station: no way. Don't hesitate, you don't deserve such a punishment.

Later in the afternoon I'm at Venezia Mestre for the 4th coffee of the day (I prefer not to mention the second and third because I'm a gentlemen). In front of the rail station you find "Da Tura" Bar Restaurant: nice choice for a macchiato but just perfect if want to have an "aperitivo" tasting a good Prosecco while eating cod toasts or little meat balls.

That's not a bad way to close a business day.

For the record it was a good meeting...surprisingly good: maybe this will be a day to remember.

(remember: no more than 3/4 coffees a day otherwise you'll get a rant from your doctor )
